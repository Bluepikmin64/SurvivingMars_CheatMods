You will be able to lock them into their current job. They can still be fired (like if you shutdown the building), they just won't change to a new workplace.

May cause weird issues, so I didn't add a batch function to it.

I can also make it so, they'll never change the workplace; shutdown or not (if anyone wants that).]],
