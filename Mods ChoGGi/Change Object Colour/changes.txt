Version 0.3
Changed: 
Change Colour now works with attachments (also moved the menu item to Misc, though you'll need to use F6 anyways for rocks/etc). 
Added a base color modifier to Change Colour (you can change the colour of more items, like rocks/signs).
Version 0.2
Changed: 
Change Colour now works with attachments (also moved the menu item to Misc, though you'll need to use F6 anyways for rocks/etc).
