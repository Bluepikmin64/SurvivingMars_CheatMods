Press Shift-F to set height to wherever cursor is, move cursor around to flatten ground, press Shift-F again to update buildable area.

Defaults to a radius of 2500, Shift Left/Right to change.
Change height with Shift Up/Down.
Use Mod Config to change the amount it changes when you press an arrow key.

There's a hard limit on how close to the edge you can build (I'll probably figure that out one of these days).

Included in Expanded Cheat Menu.]],
