v0.5
Da Vinci
Changed to use the built-in map editor as it can make smooth formations, paint, etc.
If you like the old way then use ECM (can do both).
Remove All Rocks also does the little rocks (takes longer).
v0.4
Added Remove All Rocks: Press Ctrl-Shift-F to show a confirmation dialog.
v0.3
Fixed issue with pipes getting marked as uneven terrain.
v0.2
Shift Left/Right to change radius.
Shift Up/Down to change height.
Added Mod Config support for the radius/height diff amount.
