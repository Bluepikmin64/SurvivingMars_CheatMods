```

##### CheatMenu
```
Contains pretty much all of mine and FLiNGs mods, as well a few more (none of the new/modified building mods though)

Enables the game's built-in cheat tools.
This can be useful for mod developers or if you just want to play the game in creative mode.
Use the F2 key to toggle the cheats menu.
A toolbar will appear at the top of the screen and an additional Cheats section will show up in most info panels on the right side of the screen.
Many of the cheat commands have keyboard shortcuts and these will function even when the menu is hidden.

Hover over menu items for a description
