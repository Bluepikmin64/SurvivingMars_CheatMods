F2: Toggle the cheats menu.
F4: Open object examiner for selected object
F5: Dump info for selected object to file (AppData/DumpedText.txt)
Ctrl+F: Fill resource of selected object

There's a cheats section in most info panels on the right side of the screen.

Many of the cheat commands have keyboard shortcuts and these will function even when the menu is hidden.
Hover over menu items for a description

### DecompileLUA
```
Contains an AutohotKey script to decompile the lua files in the hpk files
Use https://github.com/nickelc/hpk to extract them from the hpk files (don't use the --fix-lua-files flag when you extract, as DecompileLUA does that)
```
